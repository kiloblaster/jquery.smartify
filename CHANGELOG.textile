<pre><script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.smartify.js" type="text/javascript"></script></pre>

All elements to take control by Smartify required to add a class value `.smartify` and some other attributes:

<strong>For Example</strong>

<pre><img class="smartify" ng-src="img/example.jpg" width="640" height="480"></pre>
